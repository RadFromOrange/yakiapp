## Introduction

Yaki stands for "Yet Another Kubernetes IDE". Yaki is a desktop application that allows DevOps, Developers, SREs and anyone who wish the manage the applications deployed in their Kubernetes Cluster. This is built on [Tauri](https://tauri.studio). Huge shoutout to the folks developing Tauri.

### Why Another Kubernetes IDE?

There are already a number of different IDEs. Yaki offers an alternative to the existing IDEs where by
- Open Source (MIT License)
- Uses [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) instead of [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) - Leading to smaller memory footprint and other advantages. [Tauri vs. Electron](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri#utilities)
- Fully functional free version available. (If you build it, it is yours)
- No Telemetry (Except for checking for updates)
- No Sign up or Email address needed.

## Free vs Paid

The source code for Yaki is Open source and is available for anyone to build. If you build it, you can use it for free. Out of the box, the IDE runs for 30 minutes and then shuts down. The instructions for disabling this check are given [here]

In case you wish to go directly to the binaries, they can be downloaded [here](https://yaki.nirops.com/#downloads) These binaries run for 30 minutes and then shut down. By paying a nominal fee, you will be provided a key that allows you to keep using the software for perpetuity.
There is no subscription or any hidden cost beyond that.

| Platform                 | Versions        |
